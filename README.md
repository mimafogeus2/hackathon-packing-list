# Hackathon Packing List (WIP)

Going to a hackathon? You should pack. This list is here to help you to come prepared :)
Some of the items are marked
- **❗Essentials** - You're going to have a hard time participating without these.
- **⏲️time-saving items** are preparations you can make before the event and items that will save you time once you're there. Hackathons tend to be intense and time-sensitive events, and any such preparation might end up being the difference between a finished and unfinished project.
- **❤️Social items**  are items that could help others as well :)

## Work Environment

- **❗Your laptop**
- **❗Chargers**
  - Laptop
  - Mobile Phone
- **❤️Power Strip** - It will both make sure that you have an outlet and could provide one for others.
- **❤️Internet Access** - You might find yourself connected to an overly crowded network, or find that the Internet infrastructure in the event crashes. Consider having a generous mobile Internet package prepared and use a hotspot.
- **Extension Cord** - Will give you better flexibility with your sitting arrangements.
- **All the software you know you'll need, preinstalled** - Preinstalling software you know you'll be using will save you lots of valuable time. This includes:
  - **❗⏲️Editor**- The main piece of software you'll be using - IDE/text editor/graphics editor/sound editor...
  - **⏲️Technologies you'll be working with** - Any relevant server, database, runtimes, drivers you know you'll be working with.
  - **⏲️Utility software** - Any software that would help you researching, debugging, creating/editing content or do any other task needed for your project.
  - **⏲️Workflow tools** - Keyboard shortcuts manager, clipboard managers and any other software to allow you to make repetative stuff quickly or your work environment more convenient, **especially tools you're used to having**.
- **Headphones (consider active noise cancellation) + Music/Noise** or **Earplugs** - In most hackathons, you'll find yourself in an open space. For when you'll need to concentrate, don't forget to get your favorite method of noise masking.
If you don't use or don't like automatically generated playlists that various music services (and Youtube) offer, consider preparing your own work music playlist.
A non-music alternative to mask noises are noise generators. You'll find many, both abstract (e.g. white noise) and atmospheric (e.g. nature or coffee shop ambience) generators at many dedicated websites (e.g. [MyNoise](https://mynoise.net/)).
Be prepared with downloaded/local music/noise in case you'll have connection problems.
- **Notebook and Pens** - These might end up being the closest thing to a whiteboard you'll have access too.

## Health
- ❗❗❗**Medicine**, **Allergy Medicine**
- ❗❗❗**Special Food Requirements**

## Comfort
- **Warm Cloth** - No matter how hot it is, the AC might be freezing. It's always good to have an additional thing to wear at hackathons.
- **Comfortable Cloth** - You'll be working intensively for long times. You want to be comfy.
- **Sleepers** - MUCH more comfy than shoes, and suitable for most hackathon environments.
## Hygiene
- **❗❤️Deodorant** - Be considerate
- **❗❤️Toilet Paper** - In too many cases, it tends to end before the event does. Be prepared.
- **Toothbrush + Toothpaste** - It's easy to forget to brush your teeth after a white night of coding. You shouldn't.
## Sleeping Arrangements
If you're planning to sleep through some of the hackathon, don't forget to prepare sleeping arrangement. If you want to crash on-site, don't forget to bring:
- **Sleeping Bag** and/or **A Pillow**.
- Optionally, **A Blanket**.
- **A Change of Cloth** - Not necessary, but a nice refreshment after a night.
## Food, snacks, drinks
Check what are the food arrangements before you arrive. Some hackathons will provide meals and snacks, some will provide one meal and coffee, some will provide nothing.
In case food is not provided, going outside to nearby restaurants is a nice way for a break, but it costs time and money. Do your considerations and bring (or don't bring) food accordingly. Also, verify that you've got a way to heat your food if you're planning on doing that. Also:
- **Peronal Bottle of Water** - Even if the hackathon provides everything, it's much more convenient to have an immediate sip at a hand's reach.
- **Coffee/Tea** - If these are important to you, have a little for yourself in case the place runs out of them.
