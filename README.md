# Hackathon Packing List (WIP)

Going to a hackathon? You should pack. This list is here to help you to come prepared :)
Some of the items are marked
- **❗important items** are the bare essentials. You're going to have a hard time participating without these.
- **time-saving items (+⏲)** are preparations you can make before the event and items that will save you time once you're there. Hackathons tend to be intense and time-sensitive events, and any such preparation might end up being the difference between a finished and unfinished project.
- **Social items (+❤️)**  are items that could help others as well :)

## Work Environment

- **❗Your laptop**
- **❗Chargers**
  - Laptop
  - Mobile Phone
- **Power Strip (+❤️)** - It will both make sure that you have an outlet and could provide one for others.
- **Extension Cord** - Will give you better flexibility with your sitting arrangements.
- **All the software you know you'll need, preinstalled** (+⏲️) - Preinstalling software you know you'll be using will save you lots of valuable time. This includes:
  - ❗Editor - The main piece of software you'll be using - IDE/text editor/graphics editor/sound editor...
  - Technologies you'll be working with - Any relevant server, database, runtimes, drivers you know you'll be working with.
  - Utility software - Any software that would help you researching, debugging, creating/editing content or do any other task needed for your project.
  - Workflow tools - Keyboard shortcuts manager, clipboard managers and any other software to allow you to make repetative stuff quickly or your work environment more convenient, **especially tools you're used to having**.
- **Headphones (consider active noise cancellation) + Music/Noise** or **Earplugs** - In most hackathons, you'll find yourself in an open space. For when you'll need to concentrate, don't forget to get your favorite method of noise masking.
If you don't use or don't like automatically generated playlists that various music services (and Youtube) offer, consider preparing your own work music playlist.
A non-music alternative to mask noises are noise generators. You'll find many, both abstract (e.g. white noise) and atmospheric (e.g. nature or coffee shop ambience) generators at many dedicated websites (e.g. [MyNoise](https://mynoise.net/)).
